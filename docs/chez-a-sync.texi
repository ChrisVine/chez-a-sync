This is the chez-a-sync package.  It provides both an asynchronous
event loop for chez scheme, and coroutines to enable an event loop
(including other event loops) to be used with 'await' semantics to
deal with inversion of control -- otherwise known as ``callback
hell''.

The chez-a-sync package is provided in three R6RS library files:
@menu
* coroutines::     In library file (a-sync coroutines) - provides coroutines for await semantics on asynchronous events
* event loop::     In library file (a-sync event-loop) - provides an event loop for asynchronous events
* compose::        In library file (a-sync compose) - provides the compose-a-sync macro interface for the a-sync coroutine
@end menu
