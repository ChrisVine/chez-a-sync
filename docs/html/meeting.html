<h4 class="node-heading">meeting</h4>

<p>As explained in the <a href="overview.html">general overview</a>, each &rsquo;a-sync&rsquo;
block (see <a href="coroutines.html">(a-sync coroutines)</a>) or &rsquo;compose-a-sync&rsquo;
block (see <a href="compose.html">(a-sync compose)</a>) is a separate unit of
computation which appears within itself to proceed sequentially but
which also appears to execute concurrently with other &rsquo;a-sync&rsquo; or
&rsquo;compose-a-sync&rsquo; blocks running on the same event loop.  Each &rsquo;a-sync&rsquo;
or &rsquo;compose-a-sync&rsquo; block is therefore in some sense analogous to a
thread of execution.
</p>
<p>This (a-sync meeting) library file provides a &rsquo;meeting&rsquo; type which can
be used to synchronize between such &quot;pseudo-threads&quot; (that is, between
a-sync or compose-a-sync blocks).  A &rsquo;meeting&rsquo; object is, in terms of
communicating sequential processes, an unbuffered (synchronous)
channel.  Unbuffered channels in the CSP style are a natural fit for
use with coroutines running on a single native thread (but not
necessarily for native threads running in parallel unless combined
with work stealing).  They are therefore a natural fit for
synchronizing the &quot;pseudo-threads&quot; provided by this library.
</p>
<p>Some of the things that can be done by using meetings can also be done
using await-generator!.  Note also that any one meeting object is
strictly for use by &quot;pseudo-threads&quot; which are running on the same
event loop, and so &rsquo;ipso facto&rsquo; running in the same native OS thread.
To have other native OS threads communicate with an event-loop, use
await-task-in-thread!, await-task-in-event-loop!,
await-task-in-thread-pool!, await-generator-in-thread!,
await-generator-in-event-loop! or await-generator-in-thread-pool! (see
<a href="event-loop.html">(a-sync event-loop)</a> and <a href="thread-pool.html">(a-sync
thread-pool)</a>).  Having said that, some things, such as having one
&quot;pseudo-thread&quot; join on another &quot;pseudo-thread&quot;, are more easily done
with meeting objects.
</p>
<p>A &quot;pseudo-thread&quot; enters a meeting by applying meeting-receive (where
it is to receive a datum at the meeting) or meeting-send (where it is
to provide the datum) to a meeting object.  Once a &quot;pseudo-thread&quot;
enters a meeting it cannot leave until another co-operating
&quot;pseudo-thread&quot; also enters the meeting so the datum exchange can take
place, or until the meeting-close procedure is applied.  Once a datum
exchange has taken place, a meeting object can be reused for making
another exchange (provided the meeting object has not been closed).
</p>
<p>Synchronization occurs at the moment that the exchange of the datum
takes place.  Once one of the &quot;pseudo-threads&quot; leaves the meeting upon
meeting-receive or meeting-send (or both) returning, all subsequent
events are unsynchronized until another datum exchange is arranged.
This means that where two &quot;pseudo-threads&quot; share access to objects
other than the datum exchanged and they might be mutated, one
&quot;pseudo-thread&quot; is guaranteed to see a value of the unexchanged shared
objects which is not earlier than the value they held at the moment of
datum exchange, but it may or may not see a later value.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of a meeting object:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(set-default-event-loop!) ;; if none has yet been set
(define m1 (make-meeting))

(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (let loop ([datum (meeting-receive await resume m1)])
	    (when (not (eq? datum 'stop-iteration))
	      (display datum)
	      (newline)
	      (loop (meeting-receive await resume m1))))))

(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (let loop ([count 0])
	    (if (&lt; count 4)
		(begin
		  (meeting-send await resume m1 count)
		  (loop (+ count 1)))
		(meeting-close m1)))))
(event-loop-run!)
</pre></div>

<p>And here is one possible implementation of a parallel-map procedure
using a meeting object, for a program with an event loop (this uses
await-task-in-thread! for simplicity, but in real life you might want
to use await-task-in-thread-pool!):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(import
 (a-sync coroutines)
 (a-sync event-loop)
 (a-sync meeting)
 (a-sync compose)
 (chezscheme))

(set-default-event-loop!) ;; if none has yet been set
(event-loop-block! #t)

(define (parallel-map await resume proc lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      '()
      (let ([head (car lst)]
	    [tail (cdr lst)]
	    [m1 (make-meeting)])
	(compose-a-sync ([hd (await-task-in-thread! (lambda () (proc head)))])
			(meeting-send m1 hd))
	(let* ([tl (parallel-map await resume proc tail)]
	       [hd (meeting-receive await resume m1)])
	  (cons hd tl)))))

;; simulate a computational task which takes 1 second to complete
(define (do-work i) (sleep (make-time 'time-duration 0 1)) (* i 2)) 

(a-sync
 (lambda (await resume)
   (let ([lst (parallel-map await resume do-work (list 1 2 3 4 5))])
     (display lst)(newline)
     (event-loop-block! #f))))
(event-loop-run!)
</pre></div>

<p>See the documentation on the meeting-send and meeting-receive
procedures below for an example of multiple &quot;pseudo-threads&quot; sending
to or receiving from a single meeting object for fan in and fan out,
and for an example of those procedures &rsquo;selecting&rsquo; on more than one
meeting object.
</p>
<p>The (a-sync meeting) library file provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-make_002dmeeting">Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-meeting</strong> <em>[loop]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure makes and returns a meeting object.  Meetings are
objects on which a-sync or compose-a-sync blocks running on the same
event loop can synchronize by one passing a datum to another.  The
&rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument specifies the event loop (as constructed by
make-event-loop in the (a-sync event-loop) library file) with respect
to which the meeting will be held: it is an error if the meeting-send
or meeting-receive procedures are passed a different event loop as an
argument.  The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional - if none is passed, or #f
is passed, then the default event loop will be chosen.
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking this procedure can be called in any native OS
thread, but since it carries out no synchronization of native threads
the user would have to provide her own synchronization if called in
other than the thread of the event loop with respect to which the
meeting will be held; so it is best if this procedure is called in the
thread of that event loop.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.13 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-meeting_003f">Scheme Procedure: <strong>meeting?</strong> <em>obj</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure indicates whether &rsquo;obj&rsquo; is a meeting object constructed
by make-meeting.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.13 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-meeting_002dclose">Scheme Procedure: <strong>meeting-close</strong> <em>meeting</em></dt>
<dd><p>This closes a meeting object.  It&rsquo;s purpose is to wake up any
&quot;pseudo-thread&quot; (that is, any a-sync or compose-a-sync block) waiting
in meeting-send or meeting-receive by causing either procedure to
return with a &rsquo;stop-iteration value.
</p>
<p>Where that is not necessary (say, the receiver already knows how many
items are to be sent), then this procedure does not need to be
applied.  It is not needed in order to release resources.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.13 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-meeting_002dready_003f">Scheme Procedure: <strong>meeting-ready?</strong> <em>meeting</em></dt>
<dd><p>This indicates whether applying message-send or message-receive (as
the case may be) to the meeting object &rsquo;meeting&rsquo; will return
immediately: in other words, this procedure will return #t if another
a-sync or compose-a-sync block is already waiting on the object or the
meeting object has been closed, otherwise #f.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.13 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-meeting_002dsend">Scheme Procedure: <strong>meeting-send</strong> <em>await resume [loop] m0 [m1 ...] datum</em></dt>
<dd><p>This sends a datum to a receiver which is running on the same event
loop as the sender, via one or more meeting objects &rsquo;m0 m1 ...&rsquo;.  If
no receiver is waiting for the datum, this procedure waits until a
receiver calls meeting-receive on one of the meeting objects to
request the datum.  If a receiver is already waiting, this procedure
passes on the datum and returns immediately.
</p>
<p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional.  If not supplied, or #f is passed,
this procedure will use the default event loop.  It is an error if
this procedure is given a different event loop than the one which was
passed to make-meeting on constructing the &rsquo;meeting&rsquo; objects.
</p>
<p>This procedure is intended to be called within a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync (which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).
</p>
<p>With version 0.13 of this library, a sender could not invoke this
procedure when another a-sync or compose-a-sync block running on the
event loop concerned was already waiting to send on the same &rsquo;meeting&rsquo;
object.  From version 0.14, multiple senders may wait on a meeting
object to permit fan in.  The provided datum of each sender will be
passed to a receiver (as and when a receiver becomes available) in the
order in which this procedure was invoked.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of such a fan in:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(set-default-event-loop!) ;; if none has yet been set
(define m1 (make-meeting))

(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (meeting-send await resume m1 &quot;Hello from a-sync1&quot;)))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (meeting-send await resume m1 &quot;Hello from a-sync2&quot;)))

(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (let next ([count 0])
	    (when (&lt; count 2)
	      (display (meeting-receive await resume m1))
	      (newline)
	      (next (+ count 1))))))
(event-loop-run!)
</pre></div>

<p>In addition, with version 0.13 of this library, only a single meeting
object could be passed to this procedure.  From version 0.14 this
procedure has &rsquo;select&rsquo;-like behavior: multiple meeting objects may be
passed and this procedure will send to the first one which becomes
available to receive the datum.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of selecting on send (here, meeting-send will send
to the first meeting which becomes available for receiving, which is
m2):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(set-default-event-loop!) ;; if none has yet been set
(define m1 (make-meeting))
(define m2 (make-meeting))

(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (meeting-send await resume m1 m2 &quot;Hello&quot;)))

(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (format #t &quot;meeting-send says: ~a~%&quot;
		     (meeting-receive await resume m2))))
(event-loop-run!)
</pre></div>

<p>Once a datum exchange has taken place, the meeting object(s) can be
reused for making another exchange (provided the meeting objects have
not been closed).
</p>
<p>This procedure must be called in the native OS thread in which the
event loop concerned runs.  To have other native OS threads
communicate with an event-loop, use await-task-in-thread!,
await-task-in-event-loop!, await-task-in-thread-pool!,
await-generator-in-thread!, await-generator-in-event-loop! or
await-generator-in-thread-pool!.
</p>
<p>This procedure always returns #f unless meeting-close has been applied
to a meeting object, in which case &rsquo;stop-iteration is returned.  Note
that if multiple meeting objects are passed to this procedure and one
of them is then closed, this procedure will return &rsquo;stop-iteration and
any wait will be abandonned.  It is usually a bad idea to close a
meeting object on which this procedure is waiting where this procedure
is selecting on more than one meeting object.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.13 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-meeting_002dreceive">Scheme Procedure: <strong>meeting-receive</strong> <em>await resume [loop] m0 [m1 ...]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This receives a datum from a sender running on the same event loop as
the receiver, via one or more meeting objects &rsquo;m0 m1 ...&rsquo;.  If no
sender is waiting to pass the datum, this procedure waits until a
sender calls meeting-send on one of the meeting objects to provide the
datum.  If a sender is already waiting, this procedure returns
immediately with the datum supplied.
</p>
<p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional.  If not supplied, or #f is passed,
this procedure will use the default event loop.  It is an error if
this procedure is given a different event loop than the one which was

meeting object to permit fan out.  The waiting receivers will be
released (as and when a sender provides a datum) in the order in which
this procedure was invoked.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of such a fan out:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(set-default-event-loop!) ;; if none has yet been set
(define m1 (make-meeting))

(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (display (meeting-receive await resume m1))
	  (newline)))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (display (meeting-receive await resume m1))
	  (newline)))

(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (let next ([count 0])
	    (when (&lt; count 2)
	      (meeting-send await resume m1 count)
	      (next (+ count 1))))))
(event-loop-run!)

	  (meeting-send await resume m1 &quot;m1&quot;)))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (meeting-send await resume m2 &quot;m2&quot;)))

(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (let next ([count 0])
	    (when (&lt; count 2)
	      (format #t &quot;Message received from ~a~%&quot;
			 (meeting-receive await resume m1 m2))
	      (next (+ count 1))))))
(event-loop-run!)
</pre></div>

<p>Once a datum exchange has taken place, the meeting object(s) can be
reused for making another exchange (provided the meeting objects have
not been closed).
</p>
<p>This procedure must be called in the native OS thread in which the

</p>
<p>This procedure always returns the datum value supplied by meeting-send
unless meeting-close has been applied to a meeting object, in which
case &rsquo;stop-iteration is returned.  Note that if multiple meeting
objects are passed to this procedure and one of them is then closed,
this procedure will return &rsquo;stop-iteration and any wait will be
