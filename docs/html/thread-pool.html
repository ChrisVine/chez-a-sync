<h4 class="node-heading">thread pool</h4>

<p>This (a-sync thread-pool) library file supplements the <a href="event-loop.html">(a-sync event-loop)</a> library file.  (a-sync event-loop) provides
asynchronous procedures which can wait on the completion of a task
running in a worker thread or on an event loop running in another
thread.  However, sometimes it is better to run tasks in a thread pool
rather than launching worker threads, particularly where the workload
suits having the number of threads in the thread pool approximating to
the number of local processors available to the program.
</p>
<p>This (a-sync thread-pool) library file provides such a thread pool,
together with two asynchronous procedures (await-task-in-thread-pool!
and await-generator-in-thread-pool!) which can wait in an event loop
for a task on the thread pool to complete and provide its result.
</p>
<p>The thread pool objects provided by this library file do not make
provision for rate limiting similar to that provided by the event
loops in <a href="event-loop.html">(a-sync event-loop)</a>.  This is because there
is no one-size-fits-all way of doing so.  One common approach is, as
in the case of the event loops provided by this library, to apply
throttling to threads which add tasks by enforcing a wait in their
thread of execution when the level of queued tasks reaches too high a
level, so hindering their ability to add new ones.  However this is
counter productive where it is a task running on the thread pool which
is adding the new tasks, particularly with a thread pool having only a
few threads running in its pool.  Another approach is to throw an
exception when adding tasks which exceed a user-selectable level.
</p>
<p>The best approach is for user code to provide its own rate limiting in
cases where the way that that code is organised means that it could
produce an excessive number of accumulating unexecuted tasks in the
thread pool, possibly by applying delays when unexecuted tasks rise in
number excessively, using timeouts with an event loop. This may be
checked for by having code call the thread-pool-get-num-tasks
procedure before adding a significant batch of new tasks in order to
test queue size, and if necessary postpone adding the new tasks until
the size of the already accumulated tasks has reduced.
</p>
<p>This library file provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-make_002dthread_002dpool">Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-thread-pool</strong> <em>size [non-blocking]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure constructs a thread pool object of native OS threads.
The &rsquo;size&rsquo; argument specifies the number of threads which will run in
the pool, and must be greater than 0.  The &rsquo;non-blocking&rsquo; argument is
optional and affects the operation of the thread-pool-stop!
procedure.  When set to #f, which is the default, that procedure will
not return until all tasks previously added to the pool have
completed.  If set to #t, the thread-pool-stop! procedure will return
immediately, before all tasks have finished.
</p>
<p>The &rsquo;size&rsquo; and &rsquo;non-blocking&rsquo; settings may subsequently be altered by
applying the thread-pool-change-size! or thread-pool-set-non-blocking!
procedure to the pool.
</p>
<p>Thread pool objects are usually best kept as top level objects,
because threads in the pool will keep alive until thread-pool-stop! is
called.  If a thread pool is constructed within a local lexical scope,
then either thread-pool-stop! must be applied to the pool before that
scope is exited, or the last task added to the pool should itself
apply thread-pool-stop! to the pool (which it can do if &rsquo;non-blocking&rsquo;
is #t).  Otherwise, the threads in the pool will remain alive
uselessly in blocked condition until the program terminates, even
though the pool may be inaccessible.
</p>
<p>This procedure will throw an exception if a &rsquo;size&rsquo; argument of less
than 1 is given, or if the system is unable to start the number of
threads given as the &rsquo;size&rsquo; argument.  If unable to start the number
of threads so given, any threads which have in fact started in the
pool will be killed.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.16 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_003f">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool?</strong> <em>obj</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure indicates whether &rsquo;obj&rsquo; is a thread pool object
constructed by make-thread-pool.

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_002dget_002dnum_002dtasks">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-get-num-tasks</strong> <em>pool</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure returns the number of tasks which the thread pool
object is at present either running in the pool or has queued for
execution.  This procedure will not throw.  It is also thread safe,
although it accesses the task number field outside the pool mutex and
therefore with relaxed memory ordering.  That enables this procedure
to be applied more efficiently for rate limiting purposes but the
result might at any one time be marginally out of date.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.16 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_002dget_002dsize">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-get-size</strong> <em>pool</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure returns the current size setting for the thread pool
(namely the number of threads that the pool runs).
</p>
<p>This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it).
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.16 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_002dchange_002dsize_0021">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-change-size!</strong> <em>pool delta</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure will increase, or if &rsquo;delta&rsquo; is negative reduce, the
number of threads which the thread pool object will run by the value
of &rsquo;delta&rsquo;.  This procedure does nothing if thread-pool-stop! has
previously been called.  This procedure is thread safe - any thread
may call it.
</p>
<p>One use for dynamic sizing of this kind is for a task to increment the
thread number where it is about to enter a call which may block
(non-asynchronously) for some time, with a view to decrementing it
later when it has finished making blocking calls, so as to enable
another thread to keep a core active.  A with-thread-pool-increment
macro is available which will do this for you automatically in an
exception-safe way (see the documentation on that macro below).
</p>
<p>Alternatively, this procedure can be used to reduce thread usage when
a full set of threads is no longer required by the program.
</p>
<p>If &rsquo;delta&rsquo; is positive, this procedure may raise an exception if the
system is unable to start the required new threads.  Because starting
new threads can be time consuming, to minimize contention new threads
are started outside the pool&rsquo;s mutex, although internal book-keeping
is done within the mutex.  One consequence is that if such an
exception is raised while another thread has concurrently tried to
reduce the size of the pool, the size of the pool may be smaller than
it was when this procedure was called.  In certain circumstances,
after an exception where no new threads can be started, the pool could
have no running threads in it (so that thread-pool-get-size returns 0)
even though some tasks previously added to the pool remain pending.
If the system can start no new threads even though none are running in
the pool, it will be significantly broken so it is not usually worth
troubling about this - the program is doomed in that event whatever.
However if that is wrong and the cause of the failure to start any
threads can be addressed, then the thread pool can be brought back
into use by calling this procedure again.

<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.16 of this library.

tasks.  However, all tasks already running or queued for execution
will be permitted to execute and complete normally.  If the

wait until all the tasks still to execute have finished before
returning, and if #t it will return straight away.

<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_002dadd_0021">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-add!</strong> <em>pool task [fail-handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure adds a new task to the thread pool.  &rsquo;task&rsquo; must be a
thunk.  If one or more threads in the pool are currently blocking and
waiting for a task, then the task will begin executing immediately in
one of the threads.  If not, the task will be queued for execution as
soon as a thread becomes available.  Tasks will begin execution in the
order in which they are added to the thread pool object.  This
procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it, including any task
running on the thread pool object).
</p>
<p>An optional handler procedure may be passed to &rsquo;fail-handler&rsquo; which
will be invoked if the task raises an exception.  If a task raises an
exception and no handler procedure is provided, the program will

<dt id="index-with_002dthread_002dpool_002dincrement">Syntax: <strong>with-thread-pool-increment</strong> <em>pool body0 body1 ...</em></dt>
<dd><p>This macro is intended to be called by a task running on a thread pool
which is about to make a blocking (non-asynchronous) call.  It will
increment the number of threads in &rsquo;pool&rsquo; by 1 (by calling
thread-pool-change-size!) so as to enable a queued task to keep a core
active, and decrement it again when execution of the body clauses has
completed.
</p>
<p>The (i) increment, (ii) execution of body clauses, and (iii)
decrement, form the three branches of a dynamic-wind, so the decrement
automatically occurs if control leaves body execution because of an
exception or other jump.
</p>
<p>As this macro starts a new thread, it may raise an exception if the
system is unable to start it.  Starting a new thread is also not free
of overhead and it may be worth profiling a prospective use case to
see if running a few more threads in the thread pool than the number
of processors in the system permanently, rather than changing it using
this macro, and letting the OS&rsquo;s scheduler handle the situation, is a
better option.

<p>This macro is first available in version 0.16 of this library.

<dd><p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional.  This procedure will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in
the thread pool specified by the &rsquo;pool&rsquo; argument.  The result of
executing &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; will then be posted to the event loop specified by
the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument, or to the default event loop if no &rsquo;loop&rsquo;
argument is provided or if #f is provided as the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument
(pattern matching is used to detect the type of the third argument),

<dd><p>The loop argument is optional.  The &rsquo;generator&rsquo; argument is a
procedure taking one argument, namely a yield argument (see the
documentation on the make-iterator procedure for further details).
This await-generator-in-thread-pool! procedure will cause &rsquo;generator&rsquo;
to run as a task in the &rsquo;pool&rsquo; thread pool, and whenever &rsquo;generator&rsquo;
yields a value this will cause &rsquo;proc&rsquo; to execute in the event loop
specified by the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument, or in the default event loop if no
